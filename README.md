# Meshtastic RFC Repository

Welcome to the RFC (Request for Comments) repository for the Meshtastic mesh networking project! This repository is a dedicated space for discussing and managing significant changes and enhancements to the Meshtastic project, which focuses on creating firmware for LoRa mesh networking radios.

## Purpose of This Repository

The Meshtastic RFC repository serves as a centralized hub for collaboratively discussing, reviewing, and deciding on major changes and new features across various Meshtastic repositories. This includes the firmware repository, client applications, and language support repos. It's important to note that this repository is for documentation and discussion only and does not contain code files.

## How to Make an RFC

1. **Familiarize with the RFC Template**: Before submitting an RFC, please review our [RFC Template](template.md). This template provides a structured format for proposing changes.

2. **Submit Your RFC as a PR**: Create your RFC using the template and submit it as a Pull Request (PR) to this repository. Your PR will serve as the primary platform for discussion about your proposal.

3. **Participate in the Discussion**: Engage with the community and project maintainers in the PR discussion. This is where your proposal will be reviewed, and feedback will be provided.

4. **Finalizing the RFC**: The discussion period will remain open until the RFC is deemed complete. Upon completion, the PR will be closed. Note that closing the PR does not necessarily mean the RFC is approved; it signifies the end of the discussion phase.

We highly encourage community involvement in the RFC process. Whether you're proposing an RFC or contributing to the discussion of someone else's, your input is valuable.
